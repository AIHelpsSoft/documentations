## Troubleshooting

If not, you might have added a filter, to filter out events generated by traffic from your own IP. You can find this filter under "admin" and then "all filters". If so, remove it (or temporarily change the IP-address, so it doesn't match). After that, generate a few events on your website and look again on the google-analytics page, under realtime traffic / events page.
